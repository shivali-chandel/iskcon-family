          <p>This Privacy Policy was last modified on January 1, 2019 and enters into effect immediately.</p>

          <p>ISKCON Family’s Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
            information that may be collected by us anytime you interact with ISKCON Family, such as when you visit one

            members. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including
            what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose
            the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at ISKCON Family
            and we go to great lengths to protect it.</p>

          <p>By providing personal information to us or through our websites, you understand and
            consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to all countries
            and territories. Please read the following privacy policy before using this
            website or providing any personally identifiable information through this website. It will be
            assumed that if you provide us with any personally identifiable information that you have read and understand
            this policy.
            Some portions of this privacy policy may not apply to information that you provide voluntarily, or that we
            may obtain, through means other than our websites, such as, but not limited to, telephone, postal mail, other
            live and print media, and other available public
            information sources. Our websites are intended for users who are located internationally.</p>

          <p>This privacy policy is part of the ISKCON Family website terms and conditions which
            governs your use of this website in general.</p>


          <h3>Why We Collect Personal Information</h3>


          <p>We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of user service. It
            enables us to give you convenient access to our content and focus on categories
            of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted
            on the latest updates, announcements, and events that you might like to hear about.</p>

          <h3>What Information We Collect and How We May Use It</h3>

          <p>There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you
            better products. For example, when you interact with ISKCON Family by phone, we may
            collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address,
            phone number, email address, etc. We may also collect information for market research
            purposes – such as your occupation and where you use your computer – to gain a better understanding of our
            users and thus provide more valuable service. We may collect
            information regarding user activities on our websites. This helps determine how to best
            provide useful information to users and to understand which parts of our websites, content, and Internet
            services are of most interest to them. We may use personal information to provide content that you have
            requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve ISKCON Family’s content. We may collect
            personal information about users of our websites through activities such as financial transactions and
            completion of forms on our websites. Such information is available to us when users register or subscribe to
            accounts or features on our websites, make online transactions, complete surveys, comment on our blogs,
            opt-in to our email marketing list, submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” form or similar
            feature, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit personal information voluntarily to us through our
            websites.</p>

          <p>If you post blog comments, use a bulletin board, chat room or other similar features on our website you
            should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users.
            Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected,
            or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. ISKCON Family is not
            responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

          <p>If you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling
            certain user features, ISKCON Family may collect that information from your interaction and the information
            could then become publicly available.
          </p>
          <h3>When We Disclose Your Information</h3>

          <p>ISKCON Family takes your privacy very seriously. ISKCON Family does not sell or rent your contact
            information to other marketers. Except as otherwise disclosed to you, we will not sell, rent or disclose your
            personal information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the personal information
            in advance and giving you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being shared.</p>

          <p>Within ISKCON Family, to help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with
            legal entities to safeguard it in accordance with ISKCON Family’s privacy
            policy. ISKCON Family will use your personal information to respond to your requests and to
            provide you with our content. We may also use your personal information to maintain our
            internal record keeping. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different
            times, including both personal information and website usage
            information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources,
            including third parties. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings,
            and the like, such as our e-newsletters), and otherwise correspond with you about events, important updates,
            etc. that we think might interest you. You may opt out of
            receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the right to opt in and opt-out
            section below. We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our
            websites and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.</p>

          <h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>ISKCON Family takes various precautions to safeguard your personal information against
            loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. The ISKCON
            Family websites use secure encryption, provided by a third party, on some web pages where credit card
            information is required.</p>


          <h3>Integrity of Your Personal Information</h3>

          <p>ISKCON Family has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date
            for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have
            the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided. And you can
            request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your
            interactions with our sales and support agents by contacting us.</p>


          <p>While ISKCON Family strives to protect the security and integrity of sensitive personal
            information provided through this website, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an
            open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee 100% that information during
            transmission through the internet or while stored in our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely
            safe from intrusion by others.
            If you contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” form or similar feature on our website, you
            should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view
            information you send by these methods in transit. Do not send sensitive information (such
            as payment card information, social security numbers, employer identification numbers,
            passwords, or pin numbers) to us via e-mail or via a “contact us” form or similar feature on
            our website. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or
            unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. In the unlikely event that we
            believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been
            compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would
            endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances,
            and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail
            as a means of such notification.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>

          <p>As is standard practice on many websites, the ISKCON Family websites use cookies, third
            party software, and other technologies to track anonymous user data to help us understand
            which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend
            there. We may also use cookies and other technologies to reinforce
            online promotions. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on
            our websites. Additionally we may use cookies to customize your experience and provide
            greater convenience each time you interact with us.</p>


          <p>Information such as your country and language helps us provide a more useful online shopping experience.
            Your contact information, product serial numbers, and information
            about your computer helps us personalize your service and provide a better experience.
            If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies you can disable cookies in your browser.</p>


          <p>Please note that certain features of the ISKCON Family websites will not be available once cookies are
            disabled.</p>


          <p>As is true of most websites, we reserve the right to gather certain information automatically
            and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
            Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data. This
            information (which does not identify individual users) may be used to analyze trends, to administer the site,
            to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
            whole. </p>

          <p>ISKCON Family will not use the information collected to market directly to a specific person. </p>

          <p>Please see privacy policies of all the third party sites that are being used by this website.</p>

          <h3>More about payment processing</h3>
          <p>Summary: No credit card information is ever stored on our servers.</p>

          <p>We use Stripe.com, one of the most reputable, secure payment processors available. For more information, you
            can visit Stripe's security policy right here!</p>

          <h3>Right to Opt-In and Opt-Out</h3>
          <p>You may have the right to “opt in” and “opt out” of certain uses of your personal information.
            For example, at the time you are requested to provide personal information on any of our
            websites, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not to receive correspondence from
            us. You may opt out of any email marketing communications with ISKCON Family by
            clicking the opt-out link in our messages, or by sending an email to us stating that you
            would like to be removed from a specific marketing list, or all communications entirely.

            relating to your account transactions. You may be contacted by ISKCON Family in connection with your
            relationship to us as a subscriber to our content and
